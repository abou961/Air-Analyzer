# Air-Analyser

## Introduction
In France during COVID pandemic there have been severals lockdowns and university were closed. Indeed, it were assumed that too many transmissions were taking places in classrooms. 

As part of my studies at <b>National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA)</b>, I developed this 5 months project which aimed to reduce transmissions in closed spaces.

## Presentation
2 products: a box with captors and a <b>Java</b> desktop application.

## Description
The box is composed of an <b>Arduino</b> card, 5 captors and analyzes in real time the air quality.
The communication with a laptop is managed by an USB connection.
The <b>Java</b> desktop application communicates with a <b>SQL</b> database. 


It allows teachers to know the air quality in the classrooms and the application also warn and advises the user in order to take the appropriate decisions (open the window and/or the door etc.).
Moreover, in the long term, this box allows to analyze the classrooms which are the most adapted to the sanitary situation in time of COVID at the school scale.
